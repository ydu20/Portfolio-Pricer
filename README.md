# Portfolio-Pricer

An app that allows you to construct a mock portfolio with different options on a single underlying, and calculates the value of that portfolio based on spot and vol changes. You can also generate graphs for how the greeks of the portfolio change based on spot/vol/time.

To run: 
`streamlit run portfolio.py`
